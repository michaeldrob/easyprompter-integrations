## Troubleshooting

- **Status shows "Connecting"** — Check that the Server URL is correct and reachable
- **Status shows "Waiting"** — Connected but no teleprompter session is active; open a script in EasyPrompter
- **Actions don't work** — Ensure a teleprompter session is active (status must be green/connected)
- **Script button stays orange** — Loading timed out after 8 seconds; check your connection and try again
- **Empty script dropdown** — Ensure you have scripts in your EasyPrompter account and that the integration key has access
